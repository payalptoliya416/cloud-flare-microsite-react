                        <p>In this panel discussion, we will examine the evolution of <strong>AI and
                          cybersecurity</strong> as dual forcesâ€”one driving innovation, the other
                          ensuring resilience. AI is redefining the digital landscape,
                          accelerating automation, and enhancing decision-making, yet it
                          also introduces new security risks, from adversarial attacks to
                          AI-powered cyber threats.</p>
                        
                        <p className="mt-3">This session will explore the interplay between AI and
                          cybersecurity, <strong>addressing how cybersecurity both protects and
                          constrains AI, ensuring its safe, responsible, and resilient
                          adoption.</strong> Against the backdrop of Singapore's National AI Strategy
                          2.0, our experts will discuss how organizations can leverage AI to
                          enhance security while mitigating its risks, shaping a secure and
                          adaptive future for enterprises and governmasents alike.</p>
